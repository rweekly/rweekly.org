###  R Project Updates

Updates from [R Core](http://developer.r-project.org/blosxom.cgi/R-devel/NEWS):

+ `configure` will use `pkg-config` to find the flags to link to `jpeg` if available (as it should be for the recently-released `jpeg-9c` and `libjpeg-turbo`). (This amends the code added in R 3.3.0 as the module name in `jpeg-9c` is not what that tested for.)

+ The `duplicated()` method for data frames is now based on `list`s (instead of string coercion). Consequently `unique()` is better distinguishing data frame rows, fixing PR#17369 and PR#17381.

+ Calling `names()` on an S4 object derived from `"environment"` behaves (by default) like calling `names()` on an ordinary environment.

+ The environment variable `R_MAX_VZISE` can now be used to specify the maximal vector heap size. On macOS, unless specified by this environment variable, the maximal vector heap size is set to the maximum on 16GB and the available physical memory. This is to avoid having the `R` process killed when macOS over-commits memory.

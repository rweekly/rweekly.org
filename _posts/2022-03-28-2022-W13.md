###  Announcement

We are resuming **RWeekly after three months of hiatus** :tada: due to the problems, we are experiencing with our infrastructure. For that reason, we apologise as we can't accept posts by RSS feed in the next few months. We can only get submission through PRs in our GitHub repository or using @rweekly_submit in Twitter. 

If you have a problem submitting any content, please don't hesitate to reach out directly to one of our team members. Thank you for being so patient!

# Images

Don't put images in the main repo, and this rule will keep the main repo size small and easy to clone.

R Weekly always uses HTTPS. To fix mixed content warning for images that are using HTTP, ask the copyright holder of the image for permission and put an copy of the image in rweekly/image repo.

Don't Use RawGit as CDN.

RawGit will no longer cache images. See https://twitter.com/rawgit/status/836744103190638592 .

For new images that will show in R Weekly issues, it is recommended to use https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ domain. And R Weekly Live only accepts https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ domain images.

Or do not use that image.

###  R Project Updates

Updates from [R Core](http://developer.r-project.org/blosxom.cgi/R-devel/NEWS):

Update from the [R Contribution Working Group](https://forwards.github.io/rcontribution/working-group) (RCWG) :

* At the October meeting LluÃ­s Revilla presented an analysis of R bug reports filed on bugzilla. The results, including many visualizations, are available at https://llrs.github.io/bugzilla_viz/bugRzilla_review.html and https://llrs.github.io/bugzilla_viz/
* We discussed the possibility of holding a bug barbecue, possibly associated with a conference, to get people together to work on fixing open bugs.
* We now have a [calendar of events](https://forwards.github.io/rcontribution/events)

  See the [minutes](https://github.com/forwards/rcontribution/blob/master/team_minutes/2021-10-26.md) for full details and the [RCWG repo README](https://github.com/forwards/rcontribution) for information on how to get involved.
